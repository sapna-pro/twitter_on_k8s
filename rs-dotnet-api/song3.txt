I will fight<br>
I will fight for you<br>
I always do until my heart<br>
Is black and blue<br>
<br>
And I will stay<br>
I will stay with you<br>
We'll make it to the other side<br>
Like lovers do<br>
<br>
I'll reach my hands out in the dark<br>
And wait for yours to interlock<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm not givin' up<br>
I'm not givin' up, givin' up<br>
No not yet<br>
Even when I'm down to my last breath<br>
Even when they say there's nothin' left<br>
So don't give up on...<br>
<br>
I'm not givin' up<br>
I'm not givin' up, givin' up<br>
No not me<br>
Even when nobody else believes<br>
I'm not goin' down that easily<br>
So don't give up on me<br>
<br>
And I will hold<br>
I'll hold onto you<br>
No matter what this world'll throw<br>
It won't shake me loose<br>
<br>
I'll reach my hands out in the dark<br>
And wait for yours to interlock<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
I'll wait for you<br>
<br>
'Cause I'm not givin' up<br>
I'm not givin' up, givin' up<br>
No not yet<br>
Even when I'm down to my last breath<br>
Even when they say there's nothin' left<br>
So don't give up on...<br>
<br>
I'm not givin' up<br>
I'm not givin' up, givin' up<br>
No not me<br>
Even when nobody else believes<br>
I'm not goin' down that easily<br>
So don't give up on me<br>
<br>
Whoa, whoa<br>
Whoa, whoa<br>
Yeah yeah yeah yeah<br>
Yeah yeah yeah<br>
<br>
I will fight<br>
I will fight for you<br>
I always do until my heart<br>
Is black and blue
